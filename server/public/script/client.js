// Create a user interface where the user can input two values 
// (2 input elements) and the select type of mathematical operation.
//  When the submit (`=` button) is clicked, capture this input, 
//  bundle it up in an object, and send this object to the server via a POST. 
//  There should also be a 'C' button that will clear the user input fields.

// Build out the server-side logic to compute the numbers as appropriate. 
// The server should be able to handle Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, 
// and Division. Once the calculation is complete, send back the OK. 
// You should do a GET request after the POST to get the actual calculation.
